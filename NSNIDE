I am an alias for some other guy; I don't exist.
I work as a janitor for a science research lab.
I have PhDs in electronics and chemistry.
I am working on my PhD in xenobiology.
My best friends are my broom and mop.
I end up fixing most what's wrong in the lab.
I read a lot of science fiction.
I have written 27 novels. All of them unpublished.
I have been to Mars. No one believes me, though.
I have snowboarded down Olympus Mons. No one believes that, either.
